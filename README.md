<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email_client`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Built With

* [Bounce2](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/bounce2/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

*This guide will be filled once development on the example setup I have is complete.*

### Prerequisites

This library assumes that you have a copy of MaiMai running on your PC correctly. For reference, this project has been developed using a copy of the [SDEY_1.99 unencrypted dump](https://mega.nz/folder/9F5RBYLY#9Pv2i1Xip63KztO-mH8mKg).

It also assumes that you are able to build a controller for the game. I will make a guide including parts and case designs once I've made them, but for now that's not ready.

In addition, the arduino controlling the state of the screen is required to ron on serial port `COM 3`. To do this on Windows 10, go to Device manager -> Ports (COM & LPT) -> Your arduino device -> Properties -> Port settings -> Advanced... -> COM Port Number.

You then have to restart your computer to ensure no other devices attempt to use it at the same time. Windows will tell you if another device is using COM 3 when you select it for the Arduino. *You have to accept the warning that the other device may act unpredictably*, as otherwise it will not change the port at all, even after restarting to the best of my knowledge.

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Show zones onscreen for easier usage
- [x] Detect which zone is pressed onscreen
    - [ ] Output to serial [as the cab would expect][1].
- [ ] Support screens with multi-touch capability
- [ ] Make zone drawing and sensing dynamic, so only a resolution needs to be input and the library can automatically rescale

See the [open issues](https://github.com/github_username/repo_name/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

* Bottersnike for their amazing work reverse engineering the MaiMai binaries, which let me make the arduino directly communicate as the cab expects from an actual screen (buttons are yet to be worked on without `DEV 1` as they work through JAMMA). Their documentation on the communication protocol of the screen can be found [here][].
